Hello, world;)
My name is Talha Berktan Ba≈ü and I am a computer engineering student at Bilkent University.  
I like learning new thing about nearly everything, so I am fascinated to try to master coding. 
Also, I love astronomy (especially cosmology) ver much, thus, probably, I will work on this branch by helping it advance wia my programs.
